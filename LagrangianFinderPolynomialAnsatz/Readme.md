I am providing the Mathematica scripts used to perform the computations in Appendix C.4 in my dissertation. 
A Lagrangian of the modified equation for a travelling wave in the wave equation discretised with the 5 point stencil is computed up to including  order h^2 using a polynomial ansatz.

Refer to comments in the files LagrangianFinder.m and LagrangianFinderFull.m

All computations have been performed in Mathematica 11.0.1.0
