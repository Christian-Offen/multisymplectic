# Compute polynomial BEA Lagrangian

A Lagrangian of the modified equation for a travelling wave in the wave equation discretised with the 5 point stencil is computed using a polynomial ansatz.

Refer to comments in the Mathematica notebook files "LagrangianFinder_PolyAnsatz.nb".

Due to theoretical constraints a polynomial ansatz in the dynamical variables is only admissible in special cases such as not rotation, zero wave speed, or special choices of the discretisation parameters.

The scripts have been created and tested with Wolfram Mathematica 12.0.
