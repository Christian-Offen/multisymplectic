# Compute polynomial BEA Lagrangian

I am providing the Mathematica scripts used to perform the computations in Appendix C.4 in my dissertation. 
A Lagrangian of the modified equation for a travelling wave in the wave equation discretised with the 5 point stencil is computed up to including  order h^2 using a polynomial ansatz.

Refer to comments in the Mathematica notebook files LagrangianFinder.m and LagrangianFinderFull.m

Due to theoretical constraints a polynomial ansatz in the dynamical variables is only admissible in special cases such as not rotation, zero wave speed, or special choices of the discretisation parameters.


All computations have been performed in Wolfram Mathematica 11.0.1.0
