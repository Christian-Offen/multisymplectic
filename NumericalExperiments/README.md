Files used for the numerical experiments in Chapter 13.5 of my dissertation. 

Instructions.
Save all files locally.
Execute "PlotOrbit_andConservedQuantity.m" using MATLAB.
Data for the equation of motions and constants are set in the file "Potentials.m"
Equations of motions can be computed with the Mathematica script "MatlabConverterPhi2.nb" which depends on "order2Data.nb".
The order h4 corrected conserved quantity related to the Hamiltonian can be computed with "ModifiedIntegral_AnsatzPoly.nb". Notice that the variable "data" can contain explicit values for all parameters which reduces computational complexity.
